# Mathematics for the Environment - Repository for Numerical Exercises

This repository contains the latest numerical exercises and code implementations in **Julia** for the book *Mathematics for the Environment* by Michael Ghil, Alain Haraux, and Jean Roux.

## 🚀 New Content Available
We have recently updated this repository to include:
- **New Numerical Exercises:** Focused on environmental modeling, geophysical fluid dynamics, and ecological systems.
- **Julia Implementations:** High-performance code for solving nonlinear equations, linear systems, and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
- **Dynamical Systems Tools:** Scripts for bifurcation analysis, attractor visualization, and stability assessment.

## 🧮 Why Julia?
The exercises leverage Julia's performance and mathematical syntax to bridge the gap between theoretical formulas and efficient computation, especially for chaotic dynamics and large-scale environmental simulations.

## 📂 Structure
- `/Exercises`: Detailed problem sets for each chapter.
- `/Scripts`: Ready-to-run Julia files (.jl).
- `/Notebooks`: Interactive Pluto or Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.

## 🛠 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Ensure you have [Julia](https://julialang.org/) installed.
3. Add required packages: `using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()`
